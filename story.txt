Amira stood there perplexed.
A train of thoughts ran through his mind
wondering where it all went south.


His perservearance had finally paid off.
The distant buzzing of helicopter blades gave him hope.
His lips cracked as he smilled.
After all the turmoil it was finally over..


The Kikuyu, one of Kenya’s largest ethnic groups, 
have a rich ancient history rooted in the central highlands of Kenya. 
According to oral traditions, the Kikuyu trace their origins to a founding couple, 
Gikuyu and Mumbi, who were believed to have settled at the sacred mountain Kirinyaga (Mount Kenya). 
The Kikuyu were primarily farmers, cultivating crops like yams, millet, and bananas, which formed 
the basis of their subsistence. Their society was organized around clans and family units, with 
governance being led by councils of elders known as Kiama. These elders oversaw community matters, 
land distribution, and disputes. The Kikuyu were also deeply spiritual, with rituals and ceremonies 
centered around prayers and offerings to Ngai (God) at sacred sites such as Mount Kenya. The community’s 
strong connection to the land and their agricultural prowess helped them thrive for centuries before 
colonial disruptions in the late 19th century.
